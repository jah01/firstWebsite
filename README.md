# firstWebsite
My first "website" coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the summer of 2018.

This is very messy code but everything works as it should. The last time this code had a legitimate update was early August of 2018. I have decided not to do too much in terms of cleaning up the code, even with the comments, but I did just want to house it here on GitHub.
